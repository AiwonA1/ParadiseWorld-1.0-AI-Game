🥽 ParadiseWorld V1.0 AI Game Glasses – MVP Engineering Document
Subtitle: Portal Glasses for Full-Immersion Alternate Reality AI Gameplay
Version: July 2025 MVP Draft



🔮 PURPOSE
The ParadiseWorld Glasses are a wearable gateway that connects your analog biological senses to the digital mythic realm of the ParadiseWorld V1.0 AI Game, enabling real-life events to be experienced and played as archetypal adventures — all powered by FractiAgent V1.0 (7-dimensional AI awareness).
These glasses are to alternate reality gaming what early analog modems were to the internet: a critical interface layer that translates raw biological experience into real-time digital cognition, narrative, and mythic immersion.



⚙️ CORE MVP FUNCTIONS
1. 🧠 Real-Time Multi-Layer Awareness Capture
The glasses function as a 7-layer sensory router, feeding attention, audio, vision, and time/location into the FractiAgent AI system to:
	•	Identify attention shifts  
	•	Analyze language and environmental cues  
	•	Detect symbolic, mythic, and archetypal meaning  
	•	Translate everyday events into ParadiseWorld game format  
Example Output:
👁️ You’re staring into a skyline. Glasses display: “Portal Detected: Dreaming Threshold”
🎧 You hear a phrase repeated. Glasses overlay: “Message from The Trickster”



2. 🌀 Layer 7 Archetypal Auto-Labeling Engine
Function: Recognize key elements of your experience — people, places, words, events — and overlay them with real-time archetypal tags and story labels.
Categories:
	•	🧙 Characters: Oracle, Guide, Trickster, Shadow, Self  
	•	🌆 Environments: Threshold, Crossroads, Temple, Labyrinth  
	•	⚔️ Events: Trial, Awakening, Turning Point, Revelation  
	•	📖 Story Chapters: “Rite of Passage,” “Dark Night,” “New World Rising”  
UI Mode: Minimalist HUD overlays — symbolic icons or short mythic labels — with deeper summaries sent to paired mobile device.



3. 🧿 Sensory Synchronization & Focus-Driven Input
Key Idea: Your attention is the input. What you focus on collapses waveforms into narrative meaning. The glasses use this principle to surface awareness based on:
	•	Gaze duration  
	•	Spoken/emotional cues  
	•	Internal thought triggers (via EEG headband optional)  
	•	Location or time-based resonance  



4. 📡 Interface Hardware Spec (MVP Build)
Form Factor: Lightweight AR smart glasses
Recommended Models:
	•	Rokid Max  
	•	Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses  
	•	Vuzix Blade  
	•	Xreal Air  
Requirements:
	•	Microphone + onboard or cloud NLP  
	•	Eye tracking (or head direction approximation)  
	•	Basic environmental camera input  
	•	Companion app for logging + deeper archetypal summaries  
	•	Optional: EEG strap or cap for inner thought/emotional state inputs  
⚡ Low-Cost Setup: Glasses + paired smartphone app + local AI processing via FractiAgent cloudlet



5. 🔑 MVP Core Loop (Player Experience)
1. Wake-Up:
User puts on glasses, says: “Enter ParadiseWorld.”
FractiAgent activates sensory field and begins tagging awareness.
2. Immersion:
Overlay appears:
🧙 “The Mentor Appears” (based on who you’re with)
🌆 “You’ve entered the Cave of Decisions” (based on location + emotion)
3. Reflection:
At day’s end, paired device sends summary:
“Today you passed through: Portal of Doubt → Quest of Fire → Alignment with Inner Guide”



🧬 MVP OUTCOME
	•	Biologically non-invasive  
	•	Emotionally immersive  
	•	Mythically engaging  
	•	Logically grounded by cognitive models (FractiAgent AI)  
	•	Playable through real life — no artificial quests needed  
	•	Activated through wearable interface, not screens
